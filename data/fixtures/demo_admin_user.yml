# Two users by default: a superadmin (we suggest reserving this account for developer use and
# removing it at production launch) and an admin (a member of the admin group). We suggest
# giving the latter account to the client. Out of the box, Apostrophe's group 
# dashboard isn't of much use to a client admin (it will be in 1.5) and the permissions 
# dashboard is just plain dangerous, so we show only the users dashboard to regular admins
